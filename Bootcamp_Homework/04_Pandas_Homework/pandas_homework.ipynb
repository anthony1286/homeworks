    "## Analysis/Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two findings that stand out the most when looking over the results.  The first is that budget per student does not correlate with overall success of the students, in reading, math, or their overall passing rate.  Schools that have a great amount of funding or think that more money is the solution to fix their problems, may not always be correct and there are other factors that need to be looked at in order to make the students successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another finding is that larger schools' students do not perform as well as the students at smaller schools.  While this is telling, missing data on the number of teachers at these schools is an important piece of missing information.  If the student/teacher ratio could be looked at, we would be able determine if the problem is the school size or the staff size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this data not being in this dataset, the other significant summary in this study was when looking at schools by school type.  Charter schools perform much better than District schools in every category, especially when looking at passing scores for math, reading, and overall.  Finding the common and uncommon traits between these two school types may help to bridge the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, I created my calculations for the results to match up with the answers in the \"PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb\" file provided.  I don't fully understand why the last three summary tables (budget per student/school size/school type) would be taking averages of the averages from the School Summary table (from the third block of code).  I would think the best way to go about this would be taking the averages of all the students' scores at those schools, rather than the schools' average scores.  I don't think it made a huge difference in this dataset, but if one of the schools' overall passing rates was 20%, and there were 50 students who attended that school, it would have a large effect on the average of that and and successful school, let's say 95% with 3000 students attending (57.5% versus 93.8% for the weighted average).  This is just what I was thinking and how I would usually go about something like this, but I wanted to mention it to see if I was thinking of this in an incorrect way."
